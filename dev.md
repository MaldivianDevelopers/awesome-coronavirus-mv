# Development Guidelines

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **If you want to contribute to Dev please change `src & data`.**
- Clone the repo
- npm install
- rename `sample.env` to `.env`
- add github auth token to `.env`
- `node src/index.js`
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but each change should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
